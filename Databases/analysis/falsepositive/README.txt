First run rnarobo for all combinations. The cut out all genomes containing ribozymes to later run trnascan.


We only ran trnascan se for the first and fourth set, because in theory all others should be contained in the first one, EXCEPT number 4! :)
Because there we have the adaptation of the motif to CNRA*, leading to new potential hits
