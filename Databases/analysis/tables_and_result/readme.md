Here, we show the dereplication of the original rNArobo-scan to remove potential duplications due to redundancies in one of the databases (for detail, see paper).
Furthermore, the script grt_drzs_and_location identifies all the delta ribozymes and saves them into a file.
The merge_and_analyze_results scripts combines the results from rnaRobo and tRNA-Scan to identify tRNA associated Theta ribozymes and create a dataframe with all import information, as well as cutting them back out from the original file as a quality control.
