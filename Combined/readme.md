Here we simply combine the obtained hits from the metagenomic, as well as the database parts of our search. We then analyze the resulting dataframe for the number of unique theta ribozymes, tRNAs, number of associated tRNAs and more. Additionally, the final table for tRNA associated Theta Ribozymes and non-tRNA associated Theta ribozymes are generated by sorting the dataframe according to the ribozyme frequency, and assigning numbers to all unique theta riubozymes and tRNAs.
