# Discovery of Theta Ribozymes in Gut Phagesâ€“Implications for tRNA and Alternative Genetic Coding


All Code underlaying the discovery of theta ribozymes.

Split into 3 major sections: 
-Databases for all analysis in annotated databases, motif improvement, taxonomic assignments, coding density and code usage analysis.
-Metagenomic for all analysis on raw reads from over 400000 metagenomic samples.
-Joined: Combining all files to the final tables (S1 and S2), including analysis for unique number of ribozymes, sorting and naming of them.
